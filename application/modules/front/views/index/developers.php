<div class=content>
At <a href="/">sunnah.com</a> we are committed to providing an
<a href="/about">open platform for hadith</a> that includes data and tools. To this end, we
have an API for consumption and <a href="https://github.com/sunnah-com">several open-source projects</a>
on which we invite contributions.
</div><br>

<h2 class=section_header>API</h2><hr>
<div class=content>
Our API offers access to a portion of our data comprising the sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (&#xFDFA;). We will add to the data available as we complete manual checks of the data.
API documentation is available at <a href="https://sunnah.api-docs.io">sunnah.api-docs.io</a>.
You will need an API key to access this data; you can
<a href="https://github.com/sunnah-com/api/issues/new?template=request-for-api-access.md&title=Request+for+API+access%3A+%5BYour+Name%5D">create an issue</a>
on our GitHub repo to request one. You may also request an offline dump of hadith data if that
is more suited to your needs (<i>not available yet</i>).

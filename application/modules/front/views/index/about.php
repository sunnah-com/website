<a name="SiteObjective"><div class=section>1. Site Objective</div></a>
<div class=content>
The goal of this website is to provide the first <em>online</em>, <em>authentic</em>, <em>searchable</em>,
and <em>multilingual</em> (English/Arabic at the individual hadith level) database of 
collections of hadith from our beloved Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him.
</div>
<br>

<a name="AboutHadith"><div class=section>2. About Hadith</div></a>
<div class=content>
Hadith are the transmitted narrations concerning the speech, actions, appearance, and approvals of
the Messenger of Allah, the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). 
Hundreds of thousands of these narrations have been carefully preserved, studied, and passed down through
the centuries, with many of them having undergone a strict procedure to verify
an authentic chain of transmission up to the Prophet (pbuh).
Hadith form the textual core of the <i>Sunnah</i>, an important source for the derivation of Islamic 
jurisprudence second only to the Qur'an.
Hadith specialists have compiled hadith in various collections with differing criteria for inclusion,
and not all hadith in all collections are necessarily authentic.
</div><br>

<a name="AboutTheWebsite"><div class=section>3. About the Website</div></a>
<div class=content>
The hadith collections currently available can be seen on the <a href="/">homepage</a>.
We are working on importing hadith from other major collections as well. 
<br><br> 
We support full search of both the English text of the hadith as well as the Arabic through
a powerful search engine based on <a href="http://lucene.apache.org">Lucene</a>. To improve your
search experience, browse through our <a href="/searchtips">Search Tips</a> and 
Lucene's <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/queryparsersyntax.html">query syntax</a> 
to create custom and accurate search queries.

<a name="ImportantNote"><div class=section>4. Important Note</div></a>
<div class=content>
We feel compelled to make an observation here: this is not a fiqh or fatwa website.
Hadith are made available on this website as a resource for research, personal study
and understanding. The text of one or a few hadith alone are not taken
as rulings by themselves; scholars have a sophisticated process using
the principles of fiqh to come up with rulings. We do not advocate do-it-yourself
fiqh using these hadith for those who are untrained in these principles.
If you have a question on a specific ruling, please ask your local scholar.
</div><br>

<a name="Fonts"><div class=section>4. Fonts</div></a>
<div class=content>
In order to best view the content on our website, we recommend
downloading and installing the <a href="http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/?page_id=608">
KFGQPC Uthman Taha Naskh font</a>. Any Arabic font with a complete set of ligatures
will also do. In particular, we use a Unicode character ﷺ to represent <i>sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam</i>.
If you do not see the character in the previous sentence, your font does not fully support Arabic.
For Urdu we recommend any Nastaliq font (such as <a href="http://www.urdujahan.com/urdu-fonts/Fajer%20Noori%20Nastalique%2015-12-2006.ttf">Fajer Noori</a>).
</div></br>

<a name="SourcesNumbering"><div class=section>6. Sources, numbering, and grading</div></a>
<div class=content>
The Arabic text on our website is sourced from <a href="http://www.al-eman.com">al-eman.com</a>
and <a href="http://hadith.al-islam.com">hadith.al-islam.com</a>. For the English
we use various translators, a full list of which will appear here shortly inshaAllah.
The English has been through two iterations of cleaning (spelling corrections etc.).
We have done our best to provide the most authentic and exact hadith possible.
<br><br>

The reader will note differences in the numbering scheme in English and Arabic.
The reason behind this is that the translator took a few liberties while translating,
sometimes splitting or combining the Arabic books, and sometimes splitting or
combining the hadith as well. This led to a new numbering for the English, while
the numbering for the Arabic remained the same.
<br><br>

On <a href="http://sunnah.com">sunnah.com</a> we realize that some people will have an English reference number that
has been popularized due to the translation, and some others may consult an Arabic
version. Sticking with one or the other is not an option due to the numerous errors
and inconsistencies (the simplest of which is splitting and combination of hadith
that have to be combined and unsplit respectively).
<br><br>

We are moving toward unified reference numbering schemes corresponding to well-known
scholars and publications (the numbering of Muhammad Fuad Abdul Baaqi is one such)
slowly. You can see an example <a href="http://sunnah.com/bukhari/2/">here</a>.
<br><br>

If the text and numbering in a book has been checked and verified, it will display a reference number in bold. Otherwise it means it is still
in progress and the Arabic references numbers may not be exact in that case.<br>

<!--For a more concrete example, Book 9 in the English translation by Shaykh Muhsin Khan
is titled "Virtues of the Prayer Hall." However, in Arabic, there is a single book named
Kitab as-Salah that includes ahadith corresponding to virtues of the prayer hall.
The translator has split one Arabic book (Kitab as-Salah) into two English books
("Prayers" and "Virtues of the Prayer Hall (Sutra of the Musalla)").
Since there is one Arabic book, we combined the two English books.
You can see the hadith corresponding to Virtues of the Prayer Hall beginning
<a href="http://sunnah.com/bukhari/8#138">here</a>.-->

We are working hard to add grade information for each hadith not in the Sahihain (Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim).
At this point we are displaying grade decisions by Shaykh al-Albani and Darussalam (Hafiz Zubair `Ali Za`i).
Eventually we hope to have grade assignments from several other distinguished <i>muhaddiths</i> such as Shaykhs 
al-Arna'ut, Ahmad Shakir, and Abu Ghuddah wherever applicable.<br>

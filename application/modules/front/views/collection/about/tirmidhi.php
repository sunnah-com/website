of the Sunnah of the Prophet (<img src="/images/sallallahu_alaihi_wa_sallam.png" height="18px">).
It contains roughly 4400 hadīth (with repetitions) in 46 books.

This collection is titled <i>Al-Jami` al-Mukhtasar min as-Sunan `an Rasulu Allah wa Ma`rifatu as-Sahih wa al-Ma`lul wa ma `alaihi al-`amal</i>
otherwise known as Jami` at-Tirmidhi.<br>

According to the commentators of Al-Jami`, Imam Tirmidhi maintained the
following conditions throughout the compilation of his book:
<ol class="list">
    <li>He never narrated hadith from those who fabricated hadith. </li>
    <li>Tahir Muqaddisi mentions that al-Jami` ut-Tirmidhi contains four types of hadith:
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Those ahadith that conform with the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim.
        <li>Those ahadith that conform with the conditions of Abu Dawud and Nasa'i.
        <li>Those ahadith that have certain discrepancies either in the sanad or matan.
        <li>Those weak hadith that some fuqaha have relied on.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Imam Tirmidhi accepts a hadith which is narrated with the word <i>`an</i> provided
    both the narrators are contemporaries.</li>
    <li>After mentioning a weak hadith, he explains the state of its weakness.</li>
    <li>A mursal hadith is accepted by Imam Tirmidhi when a chain of narrators which
    is not broken supports it.</li>
</ol>

The status of Jami` at-Tirmidhi is among the six authentic books of hadith. 
It has been categorized as fifth amongst the six most authentic
books of hadith. According to the most preferred opinion, al-Bukhari enjoys the
highest status, followed by Muslim, Abu Dawud, Nasai, Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah
respectively. Haji Khalifa in al-Kashf al-Dhunoon has categorized Tirmidhi in third
position. Al-Dhahabi has written that Tirmidhi in actual fact should be holding the
third position, but due to him bringing weak narrators like Kalbi and Masloob its
status has dropped. However, looking at the manner in which he set out his book
it seems that Haji Khalifa's opinion is best.

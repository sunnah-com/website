<p class="muslim_intro">This book contains the introductory remarks of Imam Muslim placed at the beginning of his collection. It contains a number of narrations, most of which are not <i>hadith</i> and which may not all meet the strict standards of authenticity required of all hadith in the Sahih. The translation here has been generously provided by AbÅ« Najm Fernando bin al-Iskandar.</p>
